      <h1>WHO IS VULTURE?</h1>

      <p>
        In <strong>Gray Zone Warfare</strong>, Vulture is a secretive black market vendor who operates outside the rules of engagement. He appears only at select <strong>Major Combat Outposts (CoPs)</strong>, rotating weekly across all servers ‚Äî but never at more than two CoPs at a time.
      </p>

      <p>
        According to lore on the official Gray Zone Warfare site, Vulture was active in the underground weapons trade long before the Lamang Island evacuation. When chaos took over, he saw opportunity ‚Äî growing his black market empire in the shadows of military collapse.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vulture sells items recovered from the battlefield ‚Äî specifically weapons and gear dropped by players who died and didn‚Äôt reclaim their loot. These salvaged items always have <strong>at least 95% durability</strong>. If an item was below 95% when lost, Vulture has it repaired before reselling.
      </p>

      <p>
        Not everything he sells is dynamic, however. A handful of static items are always available in his shop, providing consistent value for those who track him down and rank him up.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vulture is always tied to Major CoPs and resets <strong>every Monday at 5:00 AM EST</strong>. That‚Äôs when you‚Äôll need to start looking.
      </p>
